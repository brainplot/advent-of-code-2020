# Advent of Code 2020

## What is this?

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code contest, for the year 2020.

All the code will be in the `src/bin` directory and all input files will be in
the `src/input` folder.

## How do I compile the code?

Go to the root folder of the project and run `cargo build --release`.

> **Note:** You need to have Rust installed. You can find installation
instructions for your platform of choice on
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

### License

This code is distributed under the the `MIT` license. A copy of it is provided
in the root folder of the project.
